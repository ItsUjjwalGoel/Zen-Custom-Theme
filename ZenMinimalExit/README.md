# ‚≠ï Minimal Exit Window ‚Äì Zen Browser Mod

A clean and elegant `userChrome.css` mod that replaces the traditional window controls (minimize, maximize, close) with **three subtle dots**. On hover, each dot fills with color and expands slightly to indicate interactivity.

Perfect for users who want a minimal, modern look without the visual clutter of standard buttons.
